PickDbByColor
==========================================
The PickDbByColor script provides a mechanism for you to select database
entities by their color and then apply a command to them.

Entities to be selected are governed by:

1. Line Color: This is the entities' secondary color, the one set in 
the Advanced frame of the Attributes command (Color 2).
2. Surface Color: This is the entities' primary color.
3. By checking "Include hidden entities" they may be acted upon as well.

The actions to be applied to these entities are:

1. They can be moved to a layer.
2. They can be enabled or disabled.
3. They can be added to a group.

Note that because this script is a Pointwise/Glyph 2 version of a 
Gridgen script, the nomenclature used may seem out of date.
